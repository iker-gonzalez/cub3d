## üó£Ô∏è About

> Small simulated 3D game inspired by the famous [Wolfenstein 3D game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=561sPCk6ByE). We need to create a "realistic" 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first person perspective, using ray casting principles.

**screenshots from our actual game coming soon**

For detailed information, refer to the [**subject of this project**](https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/42_cursus/blob/main/_PDFs/en.subject_cub3d.pdf)


 ## üõ†Ô∏è Usage
Clone the repository in your computer using the following command:

`git clone https://github.com/iker-gonzalez/cub3d.git`
 
Then, you need to run the command `make` on the root directory.

This will compile the executable file `cub3d`

Last, run `./cub3d maps/map_of_your_choice`


## Game
To play this game you can use any map of your choice as long follow the following rules:

* The extension needs to be `.cub`
* It must be surrounded by walls `1`
* Characters allowed:

|  Character  |          Object                         |
|:-----------:|:---------------------------------------:|
|     *1*     | wall                                    |
|     *0*     | Empty                                   |
|     *N*     | Player starting position (north facing) |
|     *E*     | Player starting position (east facing)  |
|     *S*     | Player starting position (south facing) |
|     *W*     | Player starting position (west facing)  |

### Controls
You can use `AWSD` to move `UP`, `DOWN`, `LEFT`, `RIGHT` respectively.
Use right and left arrows to look right and left in the maze.
For restart the game press `ESC` or click on the red cross of window.
